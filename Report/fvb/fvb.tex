As well as providing a method of variational inference over the parameters of latent space Kingma and Welling also detail a method of performing full variational Bayesian inference over the parameters.


Tried FVB on random initialisation, however performed really badly:
continuous:
Lower bound: -53582.4758831, time: 0.483903589
Lower bound on validation set: -245029.915134
discrete:
Lower bound: -57463.0461588, time: 4.11004209518
Lower bound on validation set: -5434312.97123
