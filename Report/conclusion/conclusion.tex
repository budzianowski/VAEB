The analysed paper provides a clear introduction to a new methodology for performing variational inference. We managed to obtain the same results as the authors on both data sets which was partially possible thanks to the straightforward explanation of the proposed method and the detailed description of the experiments conducted. We found the model structure very robust to changes of parameters of the network. Moreover, our experiments show that the performance of VAEB is superior to that of the vanilla AE architecture and it is resistant to superfluous latent variables thanks to automatic regularisation via the KL-term. Our implementation of variational inference on both the parameters $\theta$ and the latent variables $\mathbf{z}$ performed disappointingly poorly which might be partially explained by overly-restrictive prior and we plan to further investigate this problem. The code needed to replicate our results is available at \url{https://github.com/budzianowski/VAEB}. We found this project incredibly interesting and we hope to undertake further work on the extensions proposed in the previous section.
