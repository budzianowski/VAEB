TODO:

Experiments:
  What inference procedure to use? (Adagrad)
  Direct comparison of our results and theirs - do we recover exactly what they got?
  How do different activation functions work?
  La vs Lb - just look at learning curves for one set of parameters? Or over a
    range of parameters?
  Reconstruction error - vanilla-ae vs vaeb.
  Sparse binary-inducing prior on latent space - spectrum of sparsity enforcing.

Write up:
  Theory (Will)
  Experimental results (see above).
  Some conclusions?

Poster:
  Theory VAE / AE - similarities vs dissimilarities.
  Pictures of originals vs reconstructions.
  Reconstruction errors.
  Print it out!
